# S&DS 230 Final Project

This repository contains the final project I worked on with a partner in S&DS 230: Data Exploration and Analysis.

We decided to analyze the 2016 World Bank dataset to look for any statistical relationship between Fertility and GNI, Life Expectancy and CO2 Emissions, Export Ratio and Life Expectancy, and Deforestation and CO2. In our project, we used a variety of statistical methods to accomplish our goal, which include: Regression, ANOVA, Multiple Regression, Permutation tests, Bootstrap Correlation, boxCox, Residual plots, and Tukey test.

The programming assignments for this project were all written in R.
